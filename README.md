High frequency paper trading with the following strategy:
  - Buy if we have enough money
  - Sell if we're in the black
  - Alternatively sell if we've been holding for too long

Here's a simulation for the price for acting on the price of an option every 10
seconds, for the entire time the market is open. The value of the portfolio
is in green while the value of the option is in black. These values are scaled
against their starting points to produce *relative* performance.
